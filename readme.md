# Roguelike Dungeon Crawler


----

This dungeon crawler is the last project for the React.js half of the Data Visualization certificate at [freecodecamp.com](https://www.freecodecamp.com/mattstates). Since this project was only created for desktop use, the game is not playable on mobile. In addition, the ideal screen size is probably something like 1250px x 650px. I did not optimize the styles to keep things responsive on this project since the core quality of the game would suffer at smaller screen sizes anyway.

The frameworks and tools used are:
**webpack**, **git**, **babel.js**, **react.js**, **redux.js**, **react-redux**, and **sass**.
